# CustomerSatisfied: 
### Problem Statement

Our goal is to predict the review score for a customer's next order or purchase using their historical data. We'll be utilizing the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset provided by Olist, which contains information on 100,000 orders from 2016 to 2018 made across various marketplaces in Brazil. This dataset includes diverse features such as order status, price, payment details, freight performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer reviews.

### Objective

The objective is to forecast customer satisfaction scores for upcoming orders based on features like order status, price, payment methods, and more. To achieve this in a real-world scenario, we will employ ZenML to develop a production-ready pipeline for predicting customer satisfaction scores for future purchases.

### Repository Purpose

This repository aims to demonstrate how ZenML facilitates the building and deployment of machine learning pipelines in various ways:

1. **Framework and Template:** Providing a foundation and template for your own work.
2. **Tool Integration:** Integrating with tools like MLflow for deployment, tracking, and additional functionalities.
3. **Ease of Deployment:** Simplifying the process of building and deploying your machine learning pipelines.

By following this approach, businesses can leverage ZenML to streamline the creation and deployment of machine learning models for predicting customer satisfaction.
